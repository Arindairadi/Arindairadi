Iâ€™m Arinda Iradi, a tech-driven problem solver passionate about crafting scalable, secure, and intelligent digital systems. I specialize in blockchain development, cloud computing, and full-stack web development, with a growing foundation in cybersecurity. My journey blends innovation, real-world projects, and the desire to build solutions that matter.

ðŸ’» What I Do
As a Blockchain Developer, I design simple yet powerful blockchain networks using JavaScript and integrate them into decentralized applications. I'm hands-on with blockchain fundamentals, hashing algorithms, proof-of-work concepts, and data integrity principles. Iâ€™ve developed lightweight blockchains using tools like crypto-js, and Iâ€™m expanding into smart contract development using Solidity and Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM).
As a Cloud Computing enthusiast, I deploy modern apps using Firebase, Netlify, and AWS, understanding serverless infrastructure, deployment automation, and cloud resource optimization. I aim for highly available and scalable applications with minimal configuration time.
As a Full-Stack Developer, I combine the best of both frontend and backend. My stack includes:
â€¢	Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, Tailwind, JavaScript, React.js
â€¢	Backend: Node.js, Express.js, PHP
â€¢	Databases: MySQL, MongoDB
â€¢	Version Control: Git & GitHub
â€¢	Other Tools: Postman, Docker, VS Code, Firebase, Flutterwave API (for payments)
As a Cybersecurity learner, I understand the importance of building secure applications. I apply best practices like encrypted authentication, secure database queries, input validation, and basic penetration testing tools to identify vulnerabilities.

ðŸ§  What Drives Me
I'm driven by real-world impact. Iâ€™ve worked on practical projects like:
â€¢	A blockchain-based ledger system for secure and immutable records
â€¢	A student portal for Kabale University with messaging and interactive features
â€¢	A digital e-commerce platform (Techava) with product listings, secure payments, and cloud hosting
â€¢	A mobile banking interface for Ugandan users, focusing on responsive UX and backend logic
â€¢	An E-Health Records System to streamline medical data storage securely
I believe in building tech for good â€” tools that empower communities, streamline processes, and enhance lives. Whether it's through blockchain trust mechanisms, cloud accessibility, or full-stack reliability, I aim to create solutions that are not just functional, but future-ready.
